**Mimbl** is a TypeScript component authoring library with many unique features that make the developer's life a bit easier.

### Features

- [Functional](guide/component-types.html#functional-components) and [class-based](guide/component-types.html#managed-components) components as well as custom HTML elements.
- [Independent](guide/component-types.html#independent-components) components whose lifecycle is controlled by developers and which can be accessed via standard property and method invocation.
- Built-in [trigger/watcher](trigger-watcher.html) mechanism that re-renders components upon changes in observable properties.
- [Partitioned](guide/partitioned-components.html) components that allow independent re-rendering of portions of a component.
- Component [events](guide/handling-events.html) - just like HTML element events.
- [Custom attributes](guide/custom-attributes.html) for HTML/SVG elements defined by developers and supported via handler objects.
- Service [publish/subscribe](guide/service-pub-sub.html) mechanism.
- Module [lazy-loading](guide/lazy-loading.html).
- Defining styles using <a href="https://www.mimcss.com/guide/introduction.html" target="mimcss">Mimcss</a> CSS-in-JS library.
